# IoT Mobile Weather App
### Using by AWS IoT to Communicate and a RaspberryPi to Generate Artificial Weather Readings
I will go into details on how to create an IoT mobile app for iOS using Swift and Android and iOS using React Native. Details for connecting it to the RaspberryPi are in the README files in the RaspberryPi-Thing, iPhone-Thing, and React-Native-Thing folders. I included crt, key and pem files in some application directories but they are empty just to give you an idea of where your certificates and keys should go.
